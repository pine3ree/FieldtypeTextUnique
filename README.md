# ProcessWire Unique Text Fieldtype

## This is the same as the ProcessWire Text field (FieldtypeText), but enforces that values stored are unique, site-wide.

To install, place FieldtypeTextUnique.module in /site/modules/FieldtypeTextUnique/, and then install from the Modules admin screen.

To use: create a new field and choose "TextUnique" as the type. 

To use on an existing field: edit the field (Setup > Fields > field) and then change the type to "TextUnique".
Note that the values present in your existing text field must already be unique, or the change will fail.
